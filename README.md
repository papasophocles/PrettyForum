How to install:

Creating custom templates
-------------------------
Best way to create custom templates is by copying the default templates and then edit it to your likings.
This way you'll get used to the way PrettyForum handles layouts.
Make sure that any assets you use are linked to by domain.com/assets/*asset*

** Make sure you know how to use Laravel's blade templating engine! It makes life much easier!
